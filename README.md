In this project Gesture based Desktop automation, First the model is pre-trained on the images of different hand gestures,
such as a showing numbers with fingers as 1,2,3,4 .
This model uses the integrated webcam to capture the video frame. 
The image of the gesture captured in the video frame is compared with the Pre-trained model and the gesture is identified. 
If the gesture predictes is 1,then images is blurred; 2, image is resized; 3,image is rotated etc.
